# SigNoz Docs

Use official `signoz.io` documentation and API references only. Ground every answer in fetched docs content and cite the canonical docs URL.

## Access Docs

SigNoz docs support `Accept: text/markdown`. Fetch docs pages as markdown instead of scraping HTML.

### Discover pages

Use the sitemap to search for candidate pages:

```
GET https://signoz.io/docs/sitemap.md
```

### Fetch a page

Fetch any docs page as markdown by requesting it with:

```
GET https://signoz.io/docs/<path>/
Accept: text/markdown
```

For example, to fetch the logs overview page:

```
GET https://signoz.io/docs/logs-management/overview/
Accept: text/markdown
```

## Workflow

1. **Identify the domain** from the user's question: instrumentation, OpenTelemetry setup, querying, dashboards, alerts, troubleshooting, deployment, or API docs.
2. **Check the heuristics table below**. If a heuristic matches, read that file before choosing docs pages.
3. **Search `sitemap.md` for candidate pages** that match the user's product area, environment, language, and task.
4. **Rank the best 2-5 official pages** by how directly they help the user complete the task.
5. **Fetch only the top page(s)** as markdown with `Accept: text/markdown`.
   - Fetch **one page** for narrow questions that map cleanly to a single setup guide, troubleshooting page, or API reference.
   - Fetch **multiple pages** when the task clearly spans multiple needs, such as collection-method selection plus a language guide, setup plus troubleshooting, or overview plus exact API/auth details.
   - Keep the fetch set small and purposeful. Do not fetch loosely related pages just because they share keywords.
6. **Answer from the fetched docs** and cite canonical `https://signoz.io/docs/...` URLs.
7. **Handle ambiguity deliberately**: if multiple pages are plausible, prefer the page that completes the task most directly and mention alternates only when they materially change the answer.

## Ranking Hints

- Prefer setup, troubleshooting, or API-reference pages over overview pages when the user needs an action.
- Prefer pages that match the user's runtime, language, deployment environment, or SigNoz product area.
- For API questions, prefer the exact endpoint/auth/reference page over a general guide.
- Stay within official `signoz.io` docs pages when this skill applies.

## Domain Heuristics

Read the matching heuristic file **before** fetching docs. Each file contains decision logic to route the user to the right guide.

| Topic | Trigger keywords | Heuristic file |
|---|---|---|
| Sending Logs | logs, log collection, logging, send logs | [sending-logs.md](./heuristics/sending-logs.md) |
